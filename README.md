  <h1>ðŸŒ’ Solaris-Eclipse - (Legacy)</h1>
  <p>Solaris Eclipse, created for a NASA hackathon, is an old project inspired by solar eclipses. It aims to provide an educational journey through user interactions. Designed as an engaging game, it encourages users to learn about eclipses and their impact on Earth and life. Though it's an earlier creation, it showcases my passion for blending education with entertainment.</p>
